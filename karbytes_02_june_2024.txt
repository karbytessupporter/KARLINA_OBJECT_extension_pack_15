The following paragraph was copy-pasted from a comment to an Instagram post by @decriminalizenature (and the comment was made by @mysticmimosa). The post is an image containing the following text against a gray background with the light gray silhouette of something which looks like the iris of an eye and/or the underside of a mushroom cap: "HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED AN ENCOUNTER WITH ENTITIES OR BEINGS WITH ENTHEOGENS
OR PSYCHEDELICS EXPERIENCES? COMMENT BELOW." Though I have yet to have partake in a multi-person psychedelic experience, I think that it is very likely that I will eventually have the opportunity to partake in such an experience. I generally prefer using psychedelics alone and while immersed in the wilderness.

Not necessarily an entity or but a human in another dimensional reality. The first time I partook in an ayahuasca ceremony, it was 12 of us in someone's apartment in NYC. At the end I saw myself sitting in a dry riverbed, immersed completely in the reality that I was seeing. I saw the figure of a man with a cape walking towards me, at a distance. There were animals with him, what seemed like two big dogs or wolves, and a hawk. The heat waves from the riverbed distorted the image. He walked right up to me, bent forward and scrutinized me. He seemed annoyed that I was there. Then he stood upright and pushed the center of my forehead with his finger. I immediately snapped back into this reality and the effects of the aya were completely gone. I went to the bathroom to wash my face, and when I came out I opened my mouth to tell my friend who was facilitating the journey, but he spoke first. Said he saw a man walk up to me, bend forward and examine me. Another friend who was listening jumped in and said she saw this too, and mentioned that he had a cape and there were animals with him, and that he touched my forehead. The impression that I got is that we opened a portal to some other time-space and the shamanic figure saw me butting into his reality, decided I shouldn't be there and kicked me out.
