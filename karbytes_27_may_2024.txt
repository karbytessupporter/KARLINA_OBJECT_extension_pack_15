karbytes_0: "My conceptualization of ethics features exactly one goal-oriented value: suffering (with all human goal-oriented behavior being motivated by the fundamental goal of minimizing the net suffering throughout all existence (according to at least one solipsistic perspective of reality where reality is conceptualized as being an all-encompassing whole while the facilitator of such a conceptualization assumes exactly one localized and finite frame of reference (which has first-person subjectivity)))."

karbytes_1: "I consider what karbytes_0 most recently said in this conversation to now be incorporated into my own conceptualization of reality as an all-encompassing whole. What I would suggest is that (perhaps) the most efficient way to achieve the most fundamental goal of minimizing the net suffering throughout all reality is for as many sentient beings as possible (humans in particular) to self annihilate. Each human who dies (probably) is neither currently nor at some point in the future experiencing any degree of suffering starting immediately after that human dies."

karbytes_1: "In order to prevent reality (and abstractions or conscious awareness about any aspect of reality (human generated especially)) from truncating itself (seemingly out of an overly simplistic conceptual modeling of reality and perhaps laziness (which enshrines efficiency at the expense of creativity (and at the expense of the unique pleasures which only consciously creative endeavors yield)), I thought to augment that aforementioned piece of knowledge which I referred to karbytes_0 most recently saying in this conversation (and me incorporating into my own current worldview) with an additional fundamental value (besides (the minimization of) SUFFERING): (the maximization of) SATISFACTION."

karbytes_1: "Using my updated ethics model (which posits that a moral information processing agent is always engaged in a process of making goal-oriented DECISIONs (a finite number of decision-making procedures per any given finite time period of that information processing agent's lifespan (which approaches an infinitely long time period)) such that the agent seeks to (a) minimize the net suffering experienced throughout all of reality and to (b) maximize the net satisfaction experienced throughout all of reality), merely trying to minimize suffering fails to accomplish the other essential objective. Satisfaction is what makes TIME necessary (perhaps by DESIRE alone)."
